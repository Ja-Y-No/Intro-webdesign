		<summary> <p> My Childhood </p> </summary>
	
	<p><mark> I grew up in Butuan City, Philippines 8600. I spent my entire childhood in dreaming and hoping things becoming better. I've love to get in touh with you, I am so excited to have a new friends from the other side of this world, hoping that  we may connect each other, as we learn new skills such as this coding.  </mark></p>
	<p>
	To my professor, Ms. Colleen, I noticed how your approach varied as you keep changing your clothes for each video. I kinda amazed how my perception about you changed as you keep changing. I loved the way you make complicated things digestable especially for me as a newbie of this discipline.

	<p>
	Oh! by the way, if you happen to be amazed as how I measured my understanding with regards to Fundamental Concepts and appplication of HTML, please ignore it, I just put 100% there for display, actually, maybe, I'm at 10%.
